Although there is a GUI front-end, I\'d rather not mention it; the only occurrence&nbsp;I currently have is a question in the survey asking if the user actually uses it. I cannot imagine an existing user-base for the GUI front-end; but it may be for non UNIX-based users, which I think will be an entertaining statistic...</span></p></div></div>'

    + br + '<div class="default"> <div><p>Hi Shyam,</p> <p>Usually the main reason why we would want to conduct such a survey is to improve the system. I would discourage studying a non-GUI product as it is highly unlikely it will be worked on and also there is almost no UX work on CLI based products. One reason is that most CLI users have no alternatives but to learn all the intricacies involved in operating such a system, either from their own volition or because they were instructed by their boss or clients.&nbsp;</p> <p>I noticed you have emailed me regarding this as well, just thought other students may benefit if I reply here. <br></p></div></div>'
