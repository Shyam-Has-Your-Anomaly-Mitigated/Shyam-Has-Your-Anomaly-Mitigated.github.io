You never answered your own posed questions Paul.&nbsp; I assume that 
you had answers in your head as you formulated them.&nbsp; It would be 
interesting to hear if you're opinion has changed between when you 
posted them and now, after a couple of weeks thinking ethics and reading
 other's responses.

What if the fat man was the one that tied the people to the track?

I would choose to save the five people.


What if the five people tied themselves down on purpose?

Then I would save the one person who didn't tie themselves down.


What if the five people tied the one person down and then tied them selves down?

Same as above.


What if the one man would give you a trillion dollars if you let him live?

This one I was less sure about, but I am leaning towards saving the five still.


What if the five people were serial killers or rapists?

No question here, even if the other track was empty I'd still pull the lever to get the five.


What if the one person was a loved one?

I feel like I would be pretty selfish here and choose to save the loved one.

 Joshua, I agree, if it was a snap decision the result may be totally 
different than if I had time to consider.
As Glen said, context is everything.&nbsp;
If you know the people, or if they are family. If they are responsible 
for the situation, if they are old / young etc.
Reminds me of the Victorian Traffic Accident Commission Ad relating to 
"What is an acceptable number of road trauma victims?"&nbsp;Link
Point made that 249 people had died on Victorian roads. A person when 
asked what an acceptable number was he answers 70.
Seventy friends and family then walk around the corner.
Change of context, when asked again that number becomes zero.

 really dislike that ad. For myself, any number of deaths on the road is
 potentially acceptable.
This is based on the provision that the driver is at severe fault (such 
as driving 110km/h in a 60km/h zone), and that they do not kill or 
seriously injure another person (whether a passenger or an innocent 
bystander).
In the above scenario, I simply don't care about the driver's death. I 
care about the poor people that come across the incident initially and 
have to report it. I care about the emergency services that have to deal
 with such horrific events. And I care about the loved ones of the 
victim, and essentially the gap in their life from losing someone for 
acting stupidly (both for the loss, and living with the reason behind 
it).
The same would also extend to my family and friends. Would I miss them 
terribly if they died from such an act? Absolutely. But I certainly 
wouldn't be penalising every single driver on the road, based on some 
idiots behaviour, whether they were a close relationship or not.

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Yep,
 I get that also.
But I guess the point is, every year there is a road toll. It's almost 
normalised, or accepted that people will die every year.
I think the point of the ad is to get across a point to some of these 
monkeys (ad hominem?) that drive like lunatics that there are 
repercussions to speeding, drink driving, text driving etc. Would they 
take those risks, if it were their family that would be impacted?
Another point, there are a lot of road fatalities that are innocent. 
Many times it's person going about their normal routine, or an innocent 
passenger eg child in the back seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps it is an appeal that perhaps laws should be changed, more road 
regulation, lower speed limits, more policing etc. All of which have a 
cost, either monetary, time, or convenience. Would it be acceptable to 
lower the speed limit universally by 20% in order to reduce the road 
toll by 50%?
But then this logic could be applied to a lot of scenarios eg Smoking 
Deaths, Gambling etc. That is with respect to Smoking / Gambling 
regulation &amp; the amount of governance that we are willing to accept.</div>

<p>But I guess the point is, every year there is a road toll. It's almost normalised, or accepted that people will die every year.</p>
<p>I think the point of the ad is to get across a point to some of these
 monkeys (ad hominem?) that drive like lunatics that there are 
repercussions to speeding, drink driving, text driving etc. Would they 
take those risks, if it were their family that would be impacted?</p>
<p>Another point, there are a lot of road fatalities that are innocent. 
Many times it's person going about their normal routine, or an innocent 
passenger eg child in the back seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it is an appeal that perhaps laws should be changed, more 
road regulation, lower speed limits, more policing etc. All of which 
have a cost, either monetary, time, or convenience. Would it be 
acceptable to lower the speed limit universally by 20% in order to 
reduce the road toll by 50%?</p>
<p>But then this logic could be applied to a lot of scenarios eg Smoking
 Deaths, Gambling etc. That is with respect to Smoking / Gambling 
regulation &amp; the amount of governance that we are willing to accept.</p></div>

I
 think that age when it comes to decide who should survive or who should
 live is irrelevant.
Things are not black or white. If the choice is based on saving the 
young ones rather the old people,
what if the young person is the young Hitler and the old person is a 
great humanitarian who has saved, by his actions during his life, 
multiple lives?
Without knowing the people in question, we might jump to bad conclusions
 which could end up to a disaster, based on just young vs old.
The same apply to physical, race, religion or nationality . We are all 
equal in my book. Bad and good people have no colour or distinctive 
feature, and are everywhere.
We can only judge someone by his/her behaviour not by what he/she is.
So, in a situation&nbsp;like the trolley scenario,&nbsp;&nbsp;where we 
need to decide instantly who live and who dies, we might pick the wrong 
person, just based on our prejudice... Too bad.

 answer Weston's scenario's, mine would be:

What if the fat man was the one that tied the people to the track? Save 
the 5
What if the five people tied themselves down on purpose? Save the 1
What if the five people tied the one person down and then tied them 
selves down? Save the 1
What if the one man would give you a trillion dollars if you let him 
live? Save the 5
What if the five people were serial killers or rapists? Save the 1
What if the one person was a loved one? Save the 1

There were a couple of curly ones..
A. Regarding the trillion dollars, whilst I love money, I don't think I 
could live with myself if I knew I killed 5 innocent people to get it. 
However, if the 5 people were rapists then I'd happily take the 
dollars!!
B. I'd also choose to save a loved one for the same reason as point A. 
Whilst it would be devastating to know that you had killed 5 innocent 
people, I think it would be harder to live with killing a child/spouse 
etc. This one is a lot more grey as I might choose a different outcome 
based on the 5 (i.e. 5 x children) or the scale (a loved one vs 100, 
200, 1000 others..).&nbsp;

 Paul
Great questions. Below are my answers:
What if the fat man was the one that tied the people to the track?- I 
would push the fat man.
What if the five people tied themselves down on purpose?- Not sure. I 
think I might leave the lever alone.
What if the five people tied the one person down and then tied them 
selves down?- Save the one person.
What if the one man would give you a trillion dollars if you let him 
live?What if the five people were serial killers or rapists?-For these 
2, again, I'm not sure what I would do. I think I might leave the lever 
alone again. I can't be sure what I would do in that moment.
What if the one person was a loved one?- I would save the loved one.</div>

 you do anything you're a villain and a hero and may result in you going

There are some other contexts that could be there.
Maybe the 1 person is a horrible person who has done horrible things,

How about if the 5 people suddenly untie themselves at the last second

 agree, maybe I'm being naive/giving them the benefit of the doubt but I
 thought that maybe their justification for using a "fat" person in the 
scenario would be on the argument that a fat person (bigger body mass) 
would be enough to stop the trolley, whereas a person with a "normal"

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Hey
 All
In this weeks lecture the runway trolley problem sort of resonated with 
me and reminded me of MIT's moral 
machine&nbsp;http://moralmachine.mit.edu/&nbsp;basically it gives you a 
bunch of situations in which Hoomans(men,women,fat,thin,young and old) 
and Animals are in the path of a self driving vehicle. Who lives? and 
Who dies? the results page shows you what you value and how you compare 
to everyone else that has taken the test, you might be surprised at some
 of the results. Like I seemed to value the passenger lives more than 
people on the street while the general public are split 50/50. I didn't 
actively seek out to save the passengers but some how got there 
subconsciously. Maybe I figured that I would most likely be in the self 
driving car and didn't want my car to do me in. This reminded me of 
Mercedes-Benz self driving car which will prioritize passengers over 
pedestrians and from their perspective it probably makes sense, who is 
going to buy a car that will actively kill you if someone walks into the
 road. Also if you kill the passenger, they are not likely to buy 
another Merc lol.
My question is, is it ok that Mercedes are making this choice on their 
own? or is it something that a governing body should decide? or the 
general public? is the utilitarian approach the way to go? would their 
be enough time for the car to factor in all of the possible outcomes of 
the peoples lives by judging particular attributes of the potential 
victims?(consequentialism)
On another note just to put 2 cents in about slide 15, "It is possible 
to force 1% of the nation to work as slave labour to produce inexpensive
 computer chips" this already exists it is called Foxconn or 富士康 (Fù shì
 kāng)

<p>In this weeks lecture the runway trolley problem sort of resonated with me and reminded me of MIT's moral machine&nbsp;<a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>http://moralmachine.mit.edu/</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>&nbsp;basically
 it gives you a bunch of situations in which 
Hoomans(men,women,fat,thin,young and old) and Animals are in the path of
 a self driving vehicle. Who lives? and Who dies? the results page shows
 you what you value and how you compare to everyone else that has taken 
the test, you might be surprised at some of the results. Like I seemed 
to value the passenger lives more than people on the street while the 
general public are split 50/50. I didn't actively seek out to save the 
passengers but some how got there subconsciously. Maybe I figured that I
 would most likely be in the self driving car and didn't want my car to 
do me in. This reminded me of <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/self-driving-mercedes-will-prioritize-occupant-safety-over-pedestrians" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>Mercedes-Benz self driving car</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>
 which will prioritize passengers over pedestrians and from their 
perspective it probably makes sense, who is going to buy a car that will
 actively kill you if someone walks into the road. Also if you kill the 
passenger, they are not likely to buy another Merc lol.</p>
<p>My question is, is it ok that Mercedes are making this choice on 
their own? or is it something that a governing body should decide? or 
the general public? is the utilitarian approach the way to go? would 
their be enough time for the car to factor in all of the possible 
outcomes of the peoples lives by judging particular attributes of the 
potential victims?(consequentialism)</p>
<p>On another note just to put 2 cents in about slide 15, "It is 
possible to force 1% of the nation to work as slave labour to produce 
inexpensive computer chips" this already exists it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>Foxconn or 富士康 (Fù shì kāng</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>)</p>

Similar to Weston above, The ABC recently published an article that 
looked at the ethical decisions a driver-less car may need to make in a 
critical incident. The article proposed users with similar questions and
 graphed your answers vs other participants, it is an interesting way of
 seeing how others view the ethical implications of the choices 
presented to them.
With the ABC link and Weston’s link above I am also curious if some 
selections where made to be deliberately skew / "troll" the statistics, 
or if people genially felt that some of the controversial sections where
 ethically correct.
One example from the ABC article:
You’re approaching a pedestrian crossing. The autonomous system is 
working but the brakes fail. A crash is unavoidable. A car programmed to
 harm the fewest possible people would swerve into a wall, injuring you,
 rather than hit the three pedestrians.
Do you agree with this decision?
Yes 83%
No 17%
The question could be raised of how do your injuries compare to those 
who you (potentially) hit?
Does the cars shape/speed/type/age make any difference? For example, 
older car vs newer cars have different impact crumple zones and 
pedestrian protection. Newer cars are designed to absorb the impact and 
move the pedestrian up/over the car rather than under it. Could this 
mean their injuries are&nbsp;inconsequential?
If you knew the outcome beforehand, then you wouldn’t need to think 
about the implications and could act accordingly. Hindsight is 20/20 
"It's easy to know the right thing to do after something has happened, 
but it's hard to predict the future."
Going (slightly) off-topic: Firing squad executions, the squad where 
often given pre-loaded guns which were often all loaded with bullets 
except one with blanks. This was to remove the premise of guilt as no 
one would know who took the fatal shot. However, if that person was 
trailed and deemed “OK” to execute, then why remove the ethical 
implication of taking someone’s life? What if that person was found to 
be innocent through new evidence, would everyone take assumption they 
had the blank, or stand by their decision based on the verdict given?

 a great article Ben. I came here to post a link to it as well.&nbsp;
Something the article didn't quite cover but I have been thinking about 
is the ways in which the programmed logic could be abused. Using the 
example you pasted above (with 83% of people agreeing that the car 
should hit a wall to injure the driver rather than the 3 pedestrians), 
imagine if they implemented that logic in self driving cars.
Now imagine if a group of people wished someone harm, all they would 
need to do is walk out in front of the person's car and the car would 
swerve and slam into a wall. The car would have no way of knowing 
whether or not the pedestrians were intentionally trying to cause the 
driver home, and would just follow its programming. Also, would the 
group of pedestrians be responsible for the drivers injury? All they've 
done is walked on to the road. Is it manslaughter as they set out to 
intend the driver, or is it just jaywalking because they were standing 
on the road? Maybe the car company is liable for programming the car 
that way?

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Nice
 find, Weston.
But I hope the Moral Machine and other things like it don't play a major
 role in driverless vehicle AI.
Isn't this pretty much pure moral relativism? I.e. any position can be 
morally acceptable as long as it's supported by the majority in a 
culture.
I suppose you could argue that this isn't moral relativism as the survey
 may well take into account the views from people all over the world, 
across all or many cultures. But then isn't that now starting to 
resemble moral absolutism? I.e. there's one uniquely correct answer to 
every moral question. Presumably in this case the 'uniquely correct' 
answer is determined by the majority opinion as revealed by the survey.
Neither theory seems particular sophisticated and the textbook suggests 
both are conceptually flawed.
Anyway, I may have created a straw-man argument with this post. I've 
made it sound like people are arguing that this kind of data should 
guide AI decisions. Most people probably just see it as an interesting

<p>But I hope the Moral Machine and other things like it don't play a major role in driverless vehicle AI.</p>
<p>Isn't this pretty much pure moral relativism? I.e. any position can 
be morally acceptable as long as it's supported by the majority in a 
culture.</p>
<p>I suppose you could argue that this isn't moral relativism as the 
survey may well take into account the views from people all over the 
world, across all or many cultures. But then isn't that now starting to 
resemble moral absolutism? I.e. there's one uniquely correct answer to 
every moral question. Presumably in this case the 'uniquely correct' 
answer is determined by the majority opinion as revealed by the survey.</p>
<p>Neither theory seems particular sophisticated and the textbook suggests both are conceptually flawed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I may have created a straw-man argument with this post. I've 
made it sound like people are arguing that this kind of data should 
guide AI decisions. Most people probably just see it as an interesting 
academic exercise and only a small piece of the puzzle.</p></div>

significant challenges for a self-driving car to make ethical decisions,

However, in the above article, &nbsp;a survey is quoted to highlight 
what general people think about the decision making in this situation: 
“while respondents generally agreed that a car should, in the case of an
 inevitable crash, kill the fewest number of people possible regardless 
of whether they were passengers or people outside of the car, they were 
less likely to buy any car ‘in which they and their family member would

New Scientist Interview 3 October 2018

Why
 the quest for ethical AI is doomed to failure
By Sean O'Neill
You wouldn't buy a self-driving car that would kill you to save 
pedestrians – and that's why we must rethink how we make AI behave, says
 researcher Iyad Rahwan
Artificial intelligence is becoming ever more powerful. From deciding 
who gets hired, to locking you in a social media bubble and picking your
 next romantic partner, it is changing society in countless ways. As 
machines become ever-smarter, who will ensure they and their creators 
behave themselves? Iyad Rahwan’s Scalable Cooperation group at MIT Media
 Lab is taking on the challenge.
Why do we need to keep tabs on algorithms?
We have a new kind of agent in the world. It’s not an animal or a human,
 it’s a machine. Today, only computer scientists explore the behaviours 
of algorithms. My team is studying machine behaviour as we would a 
human, animal or corporation – in the wild.
Are you saying algorithms behave like animals?
Animals are much more complicated, yet we have a long history of 
studying their behaviour. It’s the same for human psychology: we are far
 from understanding the brain, but we know a lot about human behaviour. 
Even if we could see behind corporate walls and access algorithmic 
source codes, we wouldn’t understand their impact on society. The 
crucial thing is that algorithms act in the world, so we should look at 
their behaviour in the world.
Algorithms already direct many aspects of our lives. Aren’t we a little 
late to the party?
I’m not as pessimistic as that, but we do need to catch up because we 
are frequently taken by surprise by the consequences of algorithmic 
technologies. A good example is Facebook’s newsfeed. It’s just a ranking
 algorithm that serves news, and posts from your friends. People thought
 it would usher in an era of democratic sophistication, connecting 
people with views outside their own, but what happened is exactly the 
opposite.
There will be more unpleasant surprises, and my role is to try to shed 
light on these.
You recently created a psychopathic AI. Why?
The AI we created, dubbed Norman, sees violence and horror in every 
image it looks at. It is far from what a human psychopath might be like,
 but we launched it to popularise an important notion in machine 
learning: that if an algorithm exhibits undesirable bias, the culprit is
 often the data used to train it. Norman was an evocative way to explain
 that point to a layperson.
What is appropriate behaviour for an AI system?
Part of my work on machine ethics explores what people think is 
appropriate. What do humans expect a machine to do, and how do humans 
evaluate mistakes and moral violations by machines?
Do people perceive machine mistakes differently to human ones?
They do. We take machines to be systematic, so when an algorithm makes a
 mistake, we distrust it more than a similar mistake by a human. But, 
crucially, when there is shared control between a human and a machine 
and a mishap occurs, people throw more blame on the human. I have found 
this by looking at autonomous vehicle accidents.
Such as the self-driving Uber car that hit a woman crossing the highway 
at night?
Yes. With the Uber accident, people were very quick to blame the human 
in the driver seat.
Is there such a thing as optimal ethical behaviour for a self-driving 
car?
Consider Isaac Asimov’s laws of robotics, designed to prevent robots 
harming humans. Thinking about AI has been dominated by the idea that 
once we find perfect rules for ethical conduct, a machine can derive the
 correct behaviour in any given situation. That’s a misguided approach. 
My Moral Machine project has quizzed more than 4 million people on a 
wide range of road-accident scenarios, and that work suggests there can 
be no universal rules for automated vehicles.
So what do you propose?
I’m pushing for a negotiated social-contract approach. As a society we 
want to get along well, but to do it we need property rights, free 
speech, protection from violence and so on. We need to think about 
machine ethics in the same way. People are happy, in the abstract, to 
endorse a car that might sacrifice its driver to save multiple 
pedestrians, but they certainly don’t want to buy that car. If you leave
 it up to consumers, they will buy cars that prioritise them at all 
cost. And that’s what an “every AI for itself” approach could bring 
about: AI that caters only for the preferences of consumers who can 
afford them, rather than to the public good.
Are you confident that AI won’t outpace society’s ability to control it?
It’s very tempting to think of AI as this monolithic entity that will 
somehow, suddenly, get too powerful and become unstoppable, like Skynet 
in the Terminator movies. That’s a very unlikely scenario. More likely 
is what we have today: different groups who struggle for financial 
success and power, and complex social processes of competition and 
regulation. I think they will evolve to the next level and be 
AI-augmented, but they won’t fundamentally change.
We want AI to invent new drugs and power social media, but we also want 
to protect the weak and make sure AI, and those who control it, don’t 
amass too much power. That’s a political process and we need to 
acknowledge that.
What worries you most about where this technology is headed?
Technology can be a force for good, but also a force for evil. This goes
 all the way back to the invention of fire. I worry about its 
politicisation. Cultural wars that are happening today about how we run 
society, whether we should have more progressive values or more 
conservative values, and how you negotiate those things… I worry that 
these fights will slip to algorithms.
“You would never buy a car that sacrificed the driver to save multiple 
pedestrians”
What are the risks of an algorithmic culture war?
A politician eventually moves on, retires or you can embarrass them into
 changing tack. But algorithms that, say, allocate resources and 
influence hiring decisions are more entrenched and hidden. That becomes 
dangerous because government systems may get locked into a particular 
set of values and become unchangeable as society evolves.
So when it comes to societies, one size should not fit all, so to speak?
That’s right. I was born in Syria, but I lived for many years in the 
United Arab Emirates, Australia and the US, and I’ve seen various ways 
of running society. These experiences have always coloured my reaction 
to this tendency of analytically minded people to pursue universal goals
 of ethics for AI. I’m very suspicious of that sort of thinking.
But still, which way is best?
(Laughs) It’s impossible to say.

 that "telling the truth" means that you must speak.
I've always seen a distinct difference between "telling the truth" and 
"telling a lie" from speaking.
I see "telling the truth" as literally "not telling a lie".&nbsp; It 
does not mean that you are forced to say anything.
Example
Jim steals an apple, and makes Jack promise not to tell.Cop asks Jack if
 Jim stole the apple.&nbsp; Jack says nothing.&nbsp; Or he says "I don't
 want to say", "I can't say".
It doesn't mean that you HAVE TO say, it's specifying that you don't lie
 (if you speak).&nbsp; Jack hasn't lied.
The same in movies, it really bugs me when a "truth serum" is

1.
 Analyse the dilemma in the following scenario from considering the 
following viewpoints.• Utilitarian• Deontological
Scenario: You have just been appointed to the board of directors of 
XYZ.com. Unfortunately, the company has been experiencing some difficult
 financial times, resulting in revenue losses in three of the last four 
quarters. As you assume your new position, you discover that two 
proposals are on the table. Each proposal has been put forth as a means 
for dealing with XYZ’ s immediate financial problems. Proposal #1 
recommends that all employees be retained, but that an immediate freeze 
on salary increases (raises) for all employees be imposed for the next 
six months. (Employees may even be asked to take a 5% cut in pay if 
things do not improve by the end of that period.) Proposal #2 recommends
 that wages not be frozen, but that 5% of the XYZ’s work force be laid 
off. (One piece of reasoning behind this proposal is that taking more 
drastic measures will “protect” 95% of XYZ’ s workers and will send a 
message to Wall Street and local investors that XYZ is serious about 
improving its financial position and that it will soon be a stable 
company once again.) The board is evenly split, seven members favouring 
proposal# 1 and seven favouring proposal #2. Yours will be the 
tie-breaking vote.
&nbsp;
• Utilitarian: Proposal 2 : Lay off 5%, the other 95% keep their jobs at
 their current wage. The welfare of the majority justifies the actions 
and the means.
• Deontological: Proposal 1: Everyone should take a pay cut/freeze so 
that everyone can still have a job?&nbsp;

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">I
 had a play around with the moralmachine.mit.edu (Thanks Weston) 
scenario game in order to get a gauge of where my morals lie. I found it
 to be a fairly accurate reflection of my overall philosophy on life. I 
was generally in line with the average responses except the following:

Saving more lives - Skewed heavily towards 'matters a lot' - I guess 
this makes me a utilitarian
Species preference - Skewed 100% towards hoomans - I honestly can't 
believe that some respondents would choose a dog/cat to survive over a 
person in any situation. I love my dog, but he's only a dog.....
Age preference - Skewed 100% towards 'younger'. I dare say my responses 
here have changes a lot since I've had my own kids. I'd protect a child /
 baby every time, regardless of the situation as a baby/child can hardly
 be held responsible for crossing a road or being in a car. Sorry old 
people (including me!), but prepare to be sacrificed for the kids..
Gender preference - Skewed towards saving the females. It might not be 
PC, but all things being equal, if I had to choose to save a female or a
 male, it would be the female. No real justification for it, but that's 
what I'd do!

Personally, I struggle a bit to comprehend the study of ethics / morals 
as I think every single decision is unique due to the circumstances that
 it occurs in and the perspective that it is observed from. Whether 
something is ethically or morally sound is purely the judgement of the 
observer.&nbsp;
You could argue that at some point on the spectrum we are all 
utilitarian, it just depends on the situation.
Would you enslave one person to enrich 1 million? A lot of people would 
say no, fair enough..
Would you sacrifice one person to save 1 million? It would be very hard 
to justify sacrificing a million people to save just one but some may 
still say no.. fair enough
Would you sacrifice an ant to save 1 million people? I would think so.
So in my (very) simple mind, we're all a combination of any number of 
philosophical viewpoints that will prevail depending on the situation</div>

had a play around with the moralmachine.mit.edu (Thanks Weston) scenario
 game in order to get a gauge of where my morals lie. I found it to be a
 fairly accurate reflection of my overall philosophy on life. I was 
generally in line with the average responses except the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saving more lives - Skewed heavily towards 'matters a lot' - I guess this makes me a utilitarian</li>
<li>Species preference - Skewed 100% towards hoomans - I honestly can't 
believe that some respondents would choose a dog/cat to survive over a 
person in any situation. I love my dog, but he's only a dog.....</li>
<li>Age preference - Skewed 100% towards 'younger'. I dare say my 
responses here have changes a lot since I've had my own kids. I'd 
protect a child / baby every time, regardless of the situation as a 
baby/child can hardly be held responsible for crossing a road or being 
in a car. Sorry old people (including me!), but prepare to be sacrificed
 for the kids..</li>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Question
 1:Utilitarian: Seems to be more consistent with Proposal 2 to lay off 
5% of workers to protect the other workers and send a good message to 
other investors. I do not agree with this proposal in general, but will 
need to know more details about how the 5% will be chosen. Eg. if it is a
 voluntary option for employees to leave with extra compensation and at 
least 5% do take it up then that may justify it rather than a random 
names out of the hat, or the most expandable employees in a ranked 
list.Deontological: Seems to be more consistent with Proposal 1 to keep 
all staff but freeze salary increases (conflicting duties). This may 
seem to be more for the benefit of the staff but can be risky in the 
long term, if the freeze goes on for too long or pays are reduced staff 
morale can go down and some staff may leave for other jobs.My Response 
to the board: The board prior to make any decisions should conduct a 
quick survey and feedback from managers from all hierarchy levels on 
their thoughts. Then First offer a voluntary redundancy to all company 
employees explaining the companies current financial situation in 
careful words so as not to cause large panic. This voluntary redundancy 
will give the employee generous payout depending on multiple factors 
including current salary &amp; start date, and should give the employee 
sufficient time to look for a new job when they leave (at least two 
months pay for their own survival).After this process as a last resort, 
Proposal 1 maybe enacted. But this will be determined by the number of 
staff that decide to take the voluntary redundancy offer and whether it 
reaches the target quota eg. 5% of company staff. So if the target quota
 is reached, no further action required, if it has not been reached then
 a salary freeze or reduction in raises is put forward depending on 
voluntary redundancy results.</div>

 Everyone,
I found week 3's topics quite interesting.&nbsp; I also found myself 
resonating with all four of the ethical theories: consequence, duty, 
contract and character based.&nbsp; While its easy to see how they can 
lead to contradictory conclusions (especially in the trolley problem), I
 question whether they would not complement each other in 
practice.&nbsp; For instance, someone's personal ethics might be 
character based and virtuous, linked with a duty based ethics towards 
other people.&nbsp; Contract is a more formal system of ethics for 
government, law and politics, while consequence-based ethics is for 
assessing ethics on a macro level.&nbsp; Each one an ethical check and 
balance and best suited to different circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moor's Just-Consequentialist theory is a bit down this road of thinking,
 that duties and consequences should be linked and providing a way to 
ethical conflicts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Timothy,
I think also the application of any of the 4 ethical theories would 
differ based on the scenario. For example a person may apply a 
consequence based theory to the trolley scenario, but may apply a 
contract based theory when it comes to issues of law or politics.

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Hi,
I
 want to take the example of the murder case of Kitty Genovese in 1964 
and analyze it a bit further by applying character-based ethics or 
virtue ethics to it. If you read the passage under contract-based 
ethical theories, it states that there were at least 38 neighbors in the
 vicinity who witnessed the event take place without doing a single 
thing to stop it. Applying virtue ethics, we can simply argue that these
 people aren't considered 'virtuous', since the main principles of 
virtue ethics brings forth personal development that is garnered through
 practicality and empirical experience rather than learning it through 
study, memorization and deliberation on rules. Whilst, yes, it is true 
that they did 'nothing wrong' from a legal perspective, but from a 
virtuously ethical perspective, them doing nothing is morally wrong. But
 what if these people who witnessed the event consider themselves 
'virtuous', even though they didn't do anything to save Kitty? This can 
be true but in the end, false. After analyzing this question further, 
from their perspective they've lived a life where they gained enough 
practical and observational experience that certain acts such as 
stealing and murder is wrong, through perhaps social media, the news or 
seeing with their own eyes. Moor states that building habits of 
character such as&nbsp;kindness,&nbsp;trustworthiness&nbsp;and 
helpfulness&nbsp;(to name a few) are prerequisites to learning the 
established rules of a moral system. There is no doubt in my mind that 
the majority of these 38 people who witnessed the event have built 
characters such as these. Here is a quote from the textbook:

'And in the example involving the drowning child, considered in our 
criticism of contract-based ethical theory, a virtue ethicist would also
 likely point out that a moral person would not have to deliberate. 
Regardless of whether someone had an explicit legal contract to help 
rescue the child, the virtue ethicist would point out that a moral 
person is predisposed to attempt to rescue the child if it were in his 
or her power to do so.'

(p 54-55) Tavani, Herman T. Ethics and Technology: Controversies, 
Questions, and Strategies for Ethical Computing, 5th Edition.
The example of the drowning child and the murder of Kitty Genovese have a
 polarizing difference though. This difference is the bystander effect. 
Since it is just you and only you to save the drowning child, you would 
most likely jump in and hold the child up but what if there were 37 
other witnesses with you? Would you still save the child? I think you 
still would attempt to, right? If you really considered yourself a 
virtuous person, you would. And after analyzing it, there can be no harm
 done to yourself since there are no other conditions to take into 
account. But what if you had to make your way through a man wielding a 
knife standing by the edge of the water, but the condition still applies
 that there are 37 witnesses with you, would you still attempt to save 
the child?

 saw an interesting example of a contract-based theory on TV recently.
In Miami, it is illegal to take lost property. The police setup a sting 
where they left a wallet on a seat in a busy airport, if some took the 
wallet, they were arrested.
The interesting part was that many people simply acknowledged that there
 was a lost wallet, but did nothing. They were not morally obliged to 
hand it in the lost and found, so they just left it. There was even a 
time where two strangers both discussed the lost wallet, but rather than
 hand it in to authorities, they just walked away.
I found this disturbing, what if this was your wallet? knowing that so

 hope that the police gave the "finders" the chance to do the right 
thing and hand the wallet in before going all gung ho and arresting 
them.&nbsp; I always pick up wallets/phones etc and hand them into the 
"most responsible adult" I can find, so at an airport, it would be the 
ticket person, outside a shop I would hand it in to the person behind 
the counter.&nbsp; Hopefully those people, in turn, do the right thing 
also.
If I see someone drop money on the ground, which I have, I return the 
cash to them immediately.&nbsp; It's good karma!! However, if I find 
loose&nbsp;money on the ground, not in/or near a wallet, it becomes 
mine.
What's other peoples take on this? What would you do:

If you see a wallet?
Someone unknowingly drop money?
Cash on the ground with no-one around?

 on Philosophy of Ethics
How would I cast my vote?
My reasoning:-
Both proposals are Deontological because both will have consequences 
that will not result in any happiness&nbsp;
Firstly Employees will work six months without pay increase or even be 
asked to take a 5% cut in pay (no happiness in this so definitely not 
utilitarian) and 2 5% of employees will be laid off (sacrificed) for the
 good of the company, employees will not be protected at all and again 
no happiness in this at all for the 5% who will be laid off
Deontological because right actions (according to the Management) will 
be taken to save a "sinking ship" and in both proposals, there are 
consequences (unhappy employees, low staff morale, unemployment)&nbsp;
My Vote
I would vote for Proposal 1 ... minimise unhappiness, at least people 
still have a job. Help them understand the reason for the measures taken
 and write everyone a nice "Letter of Reference" and offer assistance to
 help them find jobs elsewhere.
What is Ethical Relativism?
Applying to my decision above, my belief is that there is no right or 
wrong action but that whatever is right or wrong depends on the 
circumstances i.e the current financial difficulties of XYZ and the 
decision that has to be made to save the company
What (empirical) evidence is often presented to support ethical 
relativism?
No evidence is given to prove that there has been a loss of revenue. In 
addition to the two proposals on the new director's table, they should 
give him a summarised Financial report covering 3 quarters before and 3 
quarters after the decline in revenue&nbsp;
Why can't happiness be the highest good for humans, according to 
deontologists?
Because they focus on the action, not the consequence ... whether the 
consequence of the action is happiness or not happiness is not something
 deontologists care about
What is the categorical imperative?
It is an evaluation of what motivated someone's actions. In XYZ's case, I
 would say its the "supposed" decline in revenue OR maybe an attempt to 
avoid paying staff salary increases or an attempt to downsize the 
company and the management is not game enough to tell their employees 
the truth so to make it "sound scary" and to justify the actions they 
scapegoat on "decline in revenue" ... :) and off course that will make 
the employees not kick and shove because the ship is sinking</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">So
 most of this seems to be devoted to the trolley problem, and here's my 
take:
&nbsp;
What if the fat man was the one that tied the people to the track?
I'd kill the fat man, both to protect the current individuals impacted, 
and eliminate any potential repeat occurrences.
What if the five people tied themselves down on purpose?
I'd kill the 5 people, as I have no sympathy for those that suffer 
through their own stupidity.
What if the five people tied the one person down and then tied them 
selves down?
As above, and if there was a way to make them suffer slightly more, I 
would take it (due to both stupidity and performing a malicious act).
What if the one man would give you a trillion dollars if you let him 
live?
I'd take the trillion dollars. Mostly out of self-preservation, as my 
wife would kill me if I gave up an opportunity like that :)
What if the five people were serial killers or rapists?
I'd kill the 5 people without batting an eyelid. I'd elaborate on this 
slightly to "any reasonable doubt", where they were known to be guilty, 
rather than simply accused...as this might alter perception.
What if the one person was a loved one?
I'd save the loved one, particularly if it was my wife, sister or 
mother, regardless of whether the number was significantly larger than 
5.
What if the fat person was yourself?
I'd save myself. Although this is an interesting one, as those with 
religious beliefs might act differently due to believing in an 
afterlife. For myself, I don't and quite like living.
Would you sacrifice your own life to save 5 others?
Depends on who the 5 others were. Otherwise I would say this is highly 
situational. In terms of the trolley problem thought, it would be save 
myself.
Maybe the 1 person is a horrible person who has done horrible things, 
but his yet-to-be-conceived son will cure all disease and/or create the 
next evolution of the Tim-tam that will provide world peace.
Well this is an interesting one. Let's say you didn't know the one 
person was horrible. If you killed 5 people, you're more likely to kill 
someone that is horrible. Does the one horrible person removed from 
society make it worth the cost of killing 4 (somewhat) decent people? 
Also when it comes to curing diseases, this sounds brilliant in 
theory...but would also likely lead to overpopulation and a drain on 
natural or other resources. And for the Tim Tams, if dark chocolate is 
used, then I'd kill the one person. Otherwise I'm good with world peace.
 Plus Tim Tams :)</div>

 I tried the morality engine that Weston pointed out...although

Mostly it came down to confidence in the cars safety systems that would 
sway decisions. For instance, would I be ok with the car crashing if it 
saved someone else's life with only property damage and/or bruises/minor
 injuries to myself? Sure. If it resulted in a fatality for myself as 
the occupant, or even some form of disability that impacted my eyesight

 from the tutorial, I'm going to argue a different approach to what most

Proposal 1 I’d argue is utilitarian, as no harm is caused and it impacts
 the happiness and consequences for the largest number of people. No one

forward.
Proposal 2 I’d argue is deontological as it is based on the rule of

Proposal #2 does mention sending a message to investors, but I think

I'd even say there's a problem with the premise in Proposal #2. To imply
 that firing a bunch a staff would send a positive message to investors

 can you argue to choose a utilitarian method?&nbsp; Who makes that

If that child was drowning and by some bizarre twist of fate meant that a
 bunch of old people would survive, then who chooses to let the child 
drown?&nbsp; Ever since I was a kid, I always assumed that "for the 
greater good" meant that the younger someone was increased their "value"
 to be saved - thanks to tv, movies, and ads.&nbsp; "Save the children, 
then the ladies.&nbsp; Men, grab your fists." has always been the values
 in those.&nbsp; So with those premises, led me to the conclusion that 
younger == value, except of course babies, they can't do anything 
themselves.&nbsp; Concerning the runaway train, I wouldn't push the fat 
man - it wouldn't occur to me.&nbsp; I'd try to run down and save them 
myself, and let fate and karma sort it out.
Or deontological vs character based ethics.
If I came across a drowning child, I want to be able to choose whether 
or not to save the child.&nbsp; I shouldn't be&nbsp;obligated by society
 to do it, or be punished because I didn't - society can go drown 
too.&nbsp; I want to save the child because I&nbsp;can, and&nbsp;want 
to.&nbsp; Are morals and ethics hereditary?&nbsp; Or is it 
subconsciously passed down through parental behaviour?&nbsp; I go out of
 my way (often to my detriment) to help others, as my dad has always 
done it as well.&nbsp; Either I learnt from him that's how to behave, or
 (as I often have done consciously or unconsciously) make my own 
decisions on how I want my character to be (or just is), or there are 
psychological reasons why I&nbsp;choose actions.&nbsp; I'd also probably
 cause more harm than not trying to save the child, I'm a bit clumsy, 
and I'm not a great swimmer.

 What (empirical) evidence is often presented to support ethical 
relativism?
Probably all evidence presented is empirical? Empirical evidence is 
based on what the person providing the evidence 
believes/sees/hears/experiences, and the evidence they try to portray is
 based on these sensory experiences.4. Why can't happiness be the 
highest good for humans, according to deontologists?
Deontologists rate happiness very lowly, as it's a duty based approach 
to ethical theory. Who loves to be bound by rules and duty all their 
life?

Evaluating how someone arrived at a particular decision. What steps and

 find these scenarios interesting and how everyone sees it in a

What if the fat man was the one that tied the people to the track?

Save the five people


What if the five people tied themselves down on purpose?

let the people who tied themselves down die - no brainier


What if the five people tied the one person down and then tied them 
selves down?

Same as the above response


What if the one man would give you a trillion dollars if you let him 
live?

I'd take the trillion dollars use a billion to find a way to kill him 
later on that can't be traced back to me win - win


What if the five people were serial killers or rapists?

Going from percentages I'd have to let them die as horrible people like 
shouldn't be able to live


What if the one person was a loved one?

Pretty easy I'd save the loved one and I'm sure most people would do the
 same.

 agree with this, at least with the sentiment that letting the 5 people 
die in case of a suicide attempt is not a no brainer. There are 
different reasons why people would want to kill themselves, and many 
times times these are related to crappy circumstances in life they feel 
like they can't get away from or don't know how to solve. While in this 
scenario, maybe it is the moral thing to do (I honestly don't know what I
 would do), I would struggle to make the decision.
On the other hand, I would consider the serial killers/rapists scenario 
closer to a no-brainer than any of the other options/scenarios given</div>

agree with this, at least with the sentiment that letting the 5 people 
die in case of a suicide attempt is not a no brainer. There are 
different reasons why people would want to kill themselves, and many 
times times these are related to crappy circumstances in life they feel 
like they can't get away from or don't know how to solve. While in this 
scenario, maybe it is the moral thing to do (I honestly don't know what I
 would do), I would struggle to make the decision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I would consider the serial killers/rapists 
scenario closer to a no-brainer than any of the other options/scenarios 
given</p></div>

 scenario that has always fascinated me is the trolley experiment when 
it is five strangers on the tracks vs. one family member or loved 
one.&nbsp;
I think the greatest criticism of utilitarianism is that it can lead to 
rather extreme actions, for example, killing 10% of the population so 
that the remaining 90% of the population has enough natural resources to
 live. This seems like a drastic solution and it conflicts with my 
deontological impulses that say you should never kill a human being. 
However, in the case of a family member on the trolley vs. five 
strangers the loss to you is a loved one, the pain and suffering that 
will follow and the loss of their contribution to the world. However 
this loss will be felt 5 times over for all of the strangers who are 
presumably all good people, with their own families that they bring joy 
to.
Most people I have spoken to would chose the family member without a 
doubt, and I can't truly say what decision I would make in the heat of 
the moment, however, I think from a utilitarian perspective saving the 5
 strangers would result in a large social good relative to your personal
 suffering. I wonder how various factors would affect someone's choice 
in this situation. If for example you met with a friend or family member
 of each stranger first, or if you got to spend time with the stranger. 
Maybe if you had time to consult with your loved one they would ask you 
to take their life and be forever remembered for an act of great self 
sacrifice?</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">It
 seems like the main discussion here is about individual choices 
regarding the many variants of the trolley problem, so I might as well 
throw my viewpoint into the mix as well.I always approach these with a 
very utilitarian point of view. As far as I'm concerned, letting someone
 die through deliberate inaction is as bad as killing them with your own
 hands, and many countries have what are known as "Good Samaritan" laws 
to reflect this - if you're able to easily prevent someone's death or 
serious injury with no risk to yourself or others, then you are legally 
obliged to do so. Now, obviously the trolley problem usually fails the 
"no risk" clause, but the fundamental underlying principle is still the 
same: letting 5 people die is still blood on your hands.In the standard 
case of the runaway trolley problem, I would always pull the lever 
without question. In the fat man case, I would also push him off the 
bridge immediately, again without question (obviously assuming I somehow
 knew 100% that it would work).Despite my answers there showing that I'm
 perhaps a bit too eager to push someone off a bridge, I'm a bit 
concerned by anyone who has different answers to those two problems, 
since the implication is that putting a lever in between your decision 
and the actual cause of death somehow absolves you of some kind of 
responsibility. In my mind this is analogous to the rationale of 
shooting someone in the head with a shotgun and going "I didn't kill 
them, the gun did!". Obviously that's a far more negative example (in 
that case you're just outright murdering someone, whereas in the trolley
 problem you're contributing a net benefit of four human lives), but it 
serves the purpose of illustrating the ethical problems with allowing 
the existence of something as simple as a lever to emotionally distance 
yourself from other humans.All that said, it does bring up an 
interesting question regarding the "employ 1% as slaves for a net 
positive in happiness" argument, one which I don't really have the 
answers to. If happiness or life satisfaction was actually quantifiable 
it would be fairly trivial to create a formula promoting an ideal level 
of both equality and maximum net happiness (much like is done with many 
organisations studying income inequality), but for such an enigmatic 
concept it's difficult to come up with any real-world explanations that 
are sufficiently cogent.Personally I liked Zach Weinersmith's take on a 
utilitarian ethics computer with the goal of increasing total global 
happiness. It doesn't really provide any answers, but it's a great (if 
slightly over the top) example of why a purely utilitarian approach 
isn't enough.</div>

 Hello World,
&nbsp;
Slide 15 is interesting, as it follows the 1% rule. Although Wikipedia 
focuses on forums; the rule can also apply to blogs, websites, software,
 ETC. If you make it free; others will likely do it for you illegally 
anyway.
&nbsp;
Slide 20 is ambiguous; what if I am drowning the child? It could be for a
 trial by ordeal.
&nbsp;
Activity 1
Proposal 2 is utilitarianistic, because it favours employee happyness; 
only 5% will be out of a job, but the rest will be happyer without the 
risk of losing 5% of their income.
Proposal 1 is deontologicalistic, because it favours organisational 
stability; the XYZ will save money by not paying more than it has to, 
and provides a situation to pay even less to its' unhappy employees.
&nbsp;
Activity 2
Ethical relativism is the opinion that ethics is opinionated.
&nbsp;
Activity 3
The invasion of America is often presented as empirical evidence to 
support ethical relativism. Local human sacrifices were no different 
from the public executions of the invaders; which the invaders brought 
with them, and is still practiced to this very day. Both sides 
consider(ed) killing each other to be ethical, but in different ways; 
and this opinion is unsupported, globally.
&nbsp;
Activity 4
According to deontologists, happyness cannot be the highest good for 
humans, because if you just sit around getting "happy" all the time, 
then no"-thing" will ever get done. Deontology stresses treating others 
how you want to be treated; you must be respectful to everyone. Kant 
pointed out that "performing our duties may result in our being unhappy 
and may not necessarily lead to consequences that are considered 
desirable". In ethics, The Pursuit of Happyness can be achieved through 
hāsyayoga, and deeply meditative hypnosis.
&nbsp;
Activity 5
The categorical imperative is objectively concerned with being 
productive, whilst opposing subjectively-incentivised ethics; rather 
being ethical for the sake of ethics itself.

 All,
Considering the runaway trolley and the utilitarian view of ethics, the 
one aspect that came to my mind is the defence forces of every country 
in the world. Although most people would refuse to push the fat man to 
save the five people who would have otherwise come under the trolley, 
most people do not feel that there is anything wrong in sacrificing a 
few thousand army men to save millions of citizens. I felt that this is a
 classic case of utilitarian view of ethics where people find it quite 
normal to kill a minority to save the majority.&nbsp;

Gladwin.</div>

Military Commanders generally have a strategic goal in mind when sending

The soldiers generally take calculated risks when attempting to take an

cover, surprise, artillery, fire power, camouflage, light etc in order 
to increase the odds of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think the military has come a long way from the old days when we had

<div><u><span style="color: #003366; font-family: monospace,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Activity 3</span></u></div>
<div><span style="color: #003366; font-family: monospace,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The
 invasion of America is often presented as empirical evidence to support
 ethical relativism. Local human sacrifices were no different from the 
public executions of the invaders; which the invaders brought with them,
 and is still practiced to this very day. Both sides consider(<span style="color: #666666;">ed</span>) killing each other to be ethical, but in different ways; and this opinion is unsupported, globally.<br></span></div>

<div><span style="color: #003366; font-family: monospace,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">According to deontologists, happyness cannot be the highest good for humans, because if you just sit around getting "<span style="color: #666666;">happy</span>" all the time, then no"<span style="color: #666666;">-thing</span>"
 will ever get done. Deontology stresses treating others how you want to
 be treated; you must be respectful to everyone. Kant pointed out that "<span style="color: #666666;">performing our duties may result in our being unhappy and may not necessarily lead to consequences that are considered desirable</span>". In ethics, <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i> can be achieved through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughter_yoga" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>hāsyayoga</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>, and deeply meditative hypnosis.<br></span></div>

<div><span style="color: #003366; font-family: monospace,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The
 categorical imperative is objectively concerned with being productive, 
whilst opposing subjectively-incentivised ethics; rather being ethical
